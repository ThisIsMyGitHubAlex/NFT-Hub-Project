1)class controllers.HomeViewController cannot be cast to class start.DataInitializable
1- Occurs because the controller does not implement DataInitializable
2) PrintWriter.print does not write
2- it doesn't write if you don't close the printwriter afterwards with close()
3) Can't find the file path
3- Paths can be absolute or relative,
if you don't write the full path: "C:/users/.../filename" then look in the current folder
3- Remember to change any \ to / when copying the path
4) the table can scroll by a few pixels despite the fact that the sum of the columns is correct
4- Add 2 pexels in the tabel width layout or use Computed size
